A keystore file is a JSON file that contains an encrypted private key, secured with a password. For security reasons, applications often store only the keystore file, not the plain private key.</p> <p>In this blog post, we’ll demonstrate how you can recover the private key from a keystore file using PHP. This is particularly useful when you need to export or recover your private key for use in another application.</p> <h3 id="warning">Warning</h3> <p>Handling private keys directly can be risky if not done securely. Always ensure that your environment is secure and avoid exposing your private key unnecessarily.</p> <h2 id="understanding-the-keystore-structure">Understanding the Keystore Structure</h2> <p>A typical keystore file is a JSON object that contains encrypted information about the private key. Here’s an overview of the key sections in the file:</p> <ul> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crypto</code></strong>: Contains encryption-related information. <ul> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ciphertext</code></strong>: The encrypted private key.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cipher</code></strong>: The cipher algorithm used for encryption.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cipherparams</code></strong>: Contains the initialization vector (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iv</code>) used in the encryption process.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kdf</code></strong>: Key Derivation Function (KDF), either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbkdf2</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scrypt</code>, used to derive the encryption key from your password.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kdfparams</code></strong>: Parameters for the KDF, such as salt, iterations (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>), and key length (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dklen</code>).</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mac</code></strong>: Message Authentication Code, used to verify that the key derivation was successful.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="how-to-extract-the-private-key">How to Extract the Private Key</h2> <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3> <p>To extract a private key from a keystore file, you’ll need the following PHP extensions:</p> <ol> <li><strong>php-json</strong>: To parse the keystore file (as it’s a JSON format).</li> <li><strong>php-openssl</strong>: Required to decrypt the private key (since keystores use AES-128-CTR for encryption).</li> <li><strong>php-scrypt</strong>: Needed if the keystore uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scrypt</code> KDF.

Whether you’re a developer looking to deploy smart contracts or a casual user sending TRX, knowing how fees operate can save you money and make your Tron experience more efficient.</p> <h2 id="2-overview-of-tron-fees">2. Overview of Tron Fees</h2> <h3 id="what-are-tron-network-fees"><strong>What Are Tron Network Fees?</strong></h3> <p>Tron network fees are the costs incurred when executing transactions or deploying smart contracts on the Tron blockchain. Unlike many other blockchains, Tron utilizes two key resources—<strong>Bandwidth Points</strong> and <strong>Energy</strong>—to handle fees, making its fee structure pretty unique compared to EVM Blockchains. These resources are used differently based on the type of transaction being processed, making it crucial to understand how they function.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bandwidth Points</strong> for every kind of transactions, such as sending TRX TRC10 or TRC20 tokens between accounts.</li> <li><strong>Energy</strong> is consumed when executing smart contracts, especially TRC20 token transactions or complex dApps.</li> </ul> <p>In Tron you are not paying your fees directly in TRX like on other blockchains like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, instead you are paying with those two resources.</p> <h4 id="types-of-tron-fees"><strong>Types of Tron Fees</strong></h4> <p>Tron fees are categorized into two main types: <strong>Bandwidth Fees</strong> and <strong>Energy Fees</strong>, both of which have different purposes and usage scenarios.</p> <h5 id="bandwidth-points"><strong>Bandwidth Points</strong></h5> <p>Bandwidth points are primarily used for basic transactions such as transferring TRX between accounts or sending TRC-10 tokens. Each Tron account is allocated a limited number of free bandwidth points daily, allowing users to make a certain number of transactions without incurring any fees.</p> <p><strong>How Bandwidth Points Work:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bandwidth points are consumed with every transaction. For instance, a simple TRX transfer uses up bandwidth.</li> <li>Every Tron user receives <strong>600 free bandwidth points per day</strong>. Once this is exhausted, TRX is deducted as a fee for any additional transactions.</li> <li>Bandwidth can also be obtained by freezing TRX, which allows users to generate bandwidth without incurring direct costs.</li> </ul> <h5 id="energy-fees"><strong>Energy Fees</strong></h5> <p>Energy is required when executing smart contracts on the Tron network, such as interactions with TRC-20 tokens or dApp functions. Unlike bandwidth, energy is not freely available and must either be earned by freezing TRX or purchased via transaction fees in TRX.</p> <p><strong>How Energy Works:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Energy is consumed based on the complexity and computational needs of a smart contract. The more complex the contract, the more energy is required.</li> <li>Users can freeze TRX to generate energy, thereby reducing their reliance on TRX fees when using dApps or deploying contracts.</li> <li>If you don’t have enough energy, the equivalent cost will be deducted from your TRX balance.</li> </ul> <h4 id="differences-between-bandwidth-and-energy"><strong>Differences Between Bandwidth and Energy</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Bandwidth is used for all transactions (e.g., TRX transfers), while energy is only used for more complex operations involving smart contracts (e.g., TRC-20 token interactions).</li> <li><strong>Free Allowance:</strong> Users get free daily bandwidth, but there is no free energy. Energy must be earned by freezing TRX or paid for in TRX fees.</li> <li><strong>Transaction Complexity:</strong> Bandwidth is sufficient for basic transactions, but for dApp developers and those interacting with smart contracts, energy is necessary as well.</li> </ul> <h4 id="comparison-with-other-blockchains"><strong>Comparison with Other Blockchains</strong></h4> <p>Tron’s fee system is different from other popular blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, where transaction fees are paid directly in ETH or BTC. Here’s why Tron’s model stands out:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Tron generally offers much lower fees due to its energy and bandwidth allocation model, making it attractive for users and developers alike.</li> <li><strong>More Predictable Fees:</strong> With free daily bandwidth and the ability to freeze TRX for energy, users can avoid unpredictable spikes in transaction costs.</li> </ul> <p>Understanding how these resources function and how they impact Tron transactions is crucial for anyone looking to optimize their experience on the network. With this foundation, you’ll be better prepared to minimize your costs, whether you’re transacting TRX or interacting with smart contracts.</p> <h3 id="4-how-to-calculate-tron-fees-manually">4. How to Calculate Tron Fees Manually</h3> <p>Understanding how to calculate Tron fees manually can help you manage transaction costs more effectively. Tron fees are primarily based on the consumption of <strong>Bandwidth Points</strong> and <strong>Energy</strong>, which are used differently depending on the type of transaction. In this section, we’ll walk you through the process of calculating both types of fees, using practical examples.</p> <h4 id="step-by-step-guide"><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h4> <h5 id="1-calculating-bandwidth-fees"><strong>1. Calculating Bandwidth Fees</strong></h5> <p>For basic transactions, such as transferring TRX or TRC-10 tokens between wallets, you’ll primarily use <strong>Bandwidth Points</strong>. Tron automatically allocates 5,000 free bandwidth points per account daily. Once these are exhausted, the equivalent amount of TRX is deducted as a fee.</p> <p>Here’s how to calculate the fee:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Check Your Available Bandwidth</strong>: Start by checking how much bandwidth you have remaining. You can do this through Tron wallet apps like TronLink or by querying your account using Tron’s block explorer.</p> </li> <li><strong>Estimate the Bandwidth Consumption</strong>: Each TRX or TRC-10 transaction consumes a certain number of bandwidth points. For example: <ul> <li>A simple TRX transfer typically consumes <strong>250–300 bandwidth points</strong>.</li> <li>If your transaction exceeds your free daily bandwidth allocation, you’ll be charged in TRX for the remaining amount.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Calculate the Cost</strong>: If you run out of free bandwidth, Tron will charge <strong>0.001 TRX per bandwidth point</strong> needed to complete the transaction.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Formula</strong></p> <p>If you want to calculate the Bandwidth points used by an transaction, you first need to create the transaction to receive the raw data hex for your transaction.</p> <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Constants</span>

Calculating Energy Fees</strong></h5> <p>Energy is consumed when interacting with smart contracts, such as when using TRC-20 tokens or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike bandwidth, there’s no free daily energy allowance, and energy consumption can vary depending on the complexity of the smart contract.</p> <p>Here’s how to calculate energy fees:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Check Your Energy Balance</strong>: Similar to bandwidth, you can check how much energy your account has via Tron wallets or the block explorer. Energy can be obtained by freezing TRX tokens or it can be deducted as a TRX fee.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Estimate the Energy Usage</strong>: Each smart contract transaction has a specific energy requirement based on the contract’s complexity. Simple contract interactions may consume 10,000–30.000 energy, while more complex contracts could consume 100,000+ energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calculate the Energy Cost</strong>: If you don’t have enough energy, TRX will be burned from your wallet.

However, the advent of blockchain API will be crucial to unlocking blockchain interoperability and mass adoption. Thus far, there has been little incentive to change how traditional systems work. However, the unique characteristics of blockchains could speed up the adoption of new systems, which are more efficient with a reasonable investment. Making the blockchain more interoperable via APIs will speed its adoption in real-world use cases.</p> <h2 id="-what-is-blockchain-interoperability"><span class="text-dark dark:text-white"> What is Blockchain Interoperability?</span></h2> <p>Blockchain interoperability is the wide array of methods that allow blockchains to communicate and work more effectively. Most blockchains are not built to be interoperable. No matter how many features a blockchain might have, the transactions are meant to occur within one network. In the simplest terms, interoperability is the freedom to exchange data. One issue that arises when discussing interoperability is trust. If an asset leaves a network, it becomes difficult to trust its validity. Each blockchain has a consensus mechanism that it uses to validate data.

However, the advent of blockchain API will be crucial to unlocking blockchain interoperability and mass adoption. Thus far, there has been little incentive to change how traditional systems work. However, the unique characteristics of blockchains could speed up the adoption of new systems, which are more efficient with a reasonable investment. Making the blockchain more interoperable via APIs will speed its adoption in real-world use cases. What is Blockchain Interoperability? Blockchain interoperability is the wide array of methods that allow blockchains to communicate and work more effectively. Most blockchains are not built to be interoperable. No matter how many features a blockchain might have, the transactions are meant to occur within one network. In the simplest terms, interoperability is the freedom to exchange data. One issue that arises when discussing interoperability is trust. If an asset leaves a network, it becomes difficult to trust its validity. Each blockchain has a consensus mechanism that it uses to validate data. True interoperability will entail blockchains being able to understand and process the authenticity of data from different chains. While it may seem obvious that blockchains should be designed to be interoperable, it rarely happens.

To do this, they rely on software called the client that lets users interact with the blockchain via the JSON-RPC API. Users can parse and verify the blockchain while being able to read or write smart contracts.</p> <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2> <p>Hardware requirements vary by client. However, they are not that high, as the node only needs to remain synced. Before you install a client, please ensure you have the right resources to run it. The minimum requirements are:</p> <ul> <li>CPU with 2+ cores</li> <li>8 GB RAM</li> <li>2TB SSD</li> <li>10+ MBit/s bandwidth</li> </ul> <p>Recommended Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Fast CPU with 4+ cores</li> <li>16 GB+ RAM</li> <li>Fast SSD with 2+TB</li> <li>25+ MBit/s bandwidth</li> </ul> <p>All clients support all three main operating systems, which are Linux, MacOS, and Windows.</p> <h2 id="running-a-node--local-or-cloud">Running a Node – Local or Cloud</h2> <p>You can run an Ethereum node on a local computer or a cloud server like <a href="https://cryptonodes.io">Cryptonodes.io</a>, Alchemy, Blockdaemon, or QuickNode. However, to ensure censorship resistance, users should run their nodes on local hardware. Plug and Play The simplest solution for a local node is a plug-and-play box. These pre-configured machines offer a simple node experience. You buy one, connect it, and run it. The boxes feature an intuitive guide and a dashboard to monitor and control the software. Two options you can try are:</p> <ul> <li>DappNode</li> <li>Avado</li> </ul> <h2 id="ethereum-on-a-single-board-computer">Ethereum on a Single-Board Computer</h2> <p>You can run an Ethereum node on a single-board computer, such as an ARM architecture like Raspberry Pi. If you wish to do this, you can find easy-to-run images of multiple execution and consensus clients for Raspberry Pi and other ARM boards on Ethereum on ARM. However, these boards have limited performance.</p> <h2 id="setting-up-the-node">Setting up the Node</h2> <p>The client setup can be done via automated launchers or manually by setting up the software yourself. Using a launcher is recommended for less advanced users. For advanced users, the setup guide is easy to follow.</p> <h2 id="setup-guide">Setup Guide</h2> <p>Some of the best launchers out there that have automated the client setup process are:</p> <ul> <li>DappNode It does not come with a machine from the vendor. Instead, the software, node launcher, and control center can be used on any hardware.</li> <li>eth-docker This is an automated setup using Docker for easy and secure staking.

A manual setup offers more versatility. To run the node, you will need to run a pair of consensus and execution clients. Some clients have a light client and sync without requiring any software. However, full trustless verification needs both implementations.</p> <h3 id="the-client-software">The Client Software</h3> <p>The first step is to download your preferred execution client and consensus client software. You can download an executable application or an installation package that suits your architecture and OS. Ensure you verify the signatures and checksums of the packages you download. Some clients come with repositories or Docker images for easy installation and updates. All clients are open-source, which means you can build them from the source. While this is more complex, it may be required. The instructions for each client are provided in the documentation for the client lists link above. Execution clients</p> <ul> <li>Besu</li> <li>Erigon (Does not offer a pre-built binary; it has to be compiled)</li> <li>Geth</li> <li>Nethermind</li> </ul> <p>The client diversity is an issue on the execution layer. Consequently, readers should consider running a minority execution client. Consensus clients</p> <ul> <li>Lighthouse</li> <li>Lodestar (Does not come with a pre-built binary, only a Docker image or build one from source)</li> <li>Nimbus</li> <li>Prysm</li> <li>Teku</li> </ul> <p>Client diversity y is crucial for consensus nodes that run validators. If all validators are running a single client implementation, it places the network’s security at risk. It is therefore recommended to pick a minority client.</p> <h2 id="verifying-software">Verifying Software</h2> <p>When you download software from the internet, you should verify its integrity. It is one of the potential attack vectors when operating an Ethereum node. When you download a pre-built binary, ensure you trust it and take the risk that an attacker could swap the executable for a malicious program. Developers will sign their binaries with a PGP key to allow users to cryptographically verify they are running the correct software. To do this, obtain the public key from the developer in the client release pages or the documentation. You can then use a simple PGP implementation such as GnuPG to verify them. You can also use the hash and cryptographic fingerprint of the software and check that it matches the one given by the developers. It is easier than PGP, and some clients come with just this option. All you need to do is run the hash function on the software and compare it with the one from the release page.</p> <h2 id="client-setup">Client Setup</h2> <p>Once you install, download, or compile the client software, you can run it. It means that it has to be executed in the right configuration. There are numerous configuration options offered by clients, which enable various features. Sync modes are one of the most important features which can affect client performance and data usage. They represent the various methods of downloading and validating blockchain data. You must decide what network and sync mode you will use before starting a node. The things that you will consider are the disk space and sync time needed. If the default sync mode of the client does not suit your needs, pick another one based on cost, security level, and available data. You also have the option to set up pruning of old data. Pruning removes outdated data, such as state trie nodes, which are unreachable from recent blocks. Starting The Execution Client Before you start up the client software, perform a last check to ensure everything is ready. This includes checking disk space, memory, and CPU state, OS is updated, System time and data, and that your router and firewall accept connections on listening ports. To ensure everything is okay, run the client on the testnet first. Running An Execution Client Below is an example of a basic configuration to start an execution client. Running Geth The example starts Geth on the mainnet, stores data at /data/ethereum, enables JSON RPC, and defines the allowed namespaces. Additionally, it enables authentication for connecting consensus clients, which requires a path to jwtsecret, and the option defining which connections are allowed. In this example, only from localhost. 1 geth –mainnet <br/> 2 –datadir “/data/ethereum” <br/> 3 –http –authrpc.addr localhost <br/> 4 –authrpc.vhosts=”localhost” <br/> 5 –authrpc.port 8551 6 –authrpc.jwtsecret=/path/to/jwtsecret</p> <p>You can learn more about running Geth with a consensus client here. The execution client will start its core functions, pick endpoints, and begin searching for peers. Once it discovers peers, it will start syncing. The execution client will then wait for a connection from the consensus client. The current blockchain data will be available when the client has synced to the current state. Starting The Consensus Client A consensus client has to be started with the correct port configuration to establish a local RPC connection to the execution client. It has to be run with the exposed execution client port as a configuration argument. It also needs the path to the execution client’s jwt-secret to authenticate the RPC connection between them. Each consensus client has a configuration flag that takes the jwt token file path as an argument. It must be consistent with the jwtsecret path provided to the execution client. When running a validator node, ensure that you add a configuration flag that specifies the Ethereum address of the fee recipient. The address is where ether rewards are sent. Running A Consensus Client An example of a consensus client is Lodestar. To run it, install the Lodestar software by compiling it or download the Docker image. You can find an advanced setup guide here. 1 lodestar beacon <br/> 2 –rootDir=”/data/ethereum” <br/> 3 –network=mainnet <br/> 4 –eth1.enabled=true <br/> 5 –execution.urls=”http://127.0.0.1:8551” <br/> 6 –jwt-secret=”/path/to/jwtsecret”</p> <p>When the consensus client connects to the execution client to read the deposit contract and identify validators, it will also connect to other Beacon Node peers. It will then start syncing consensus slots from the genesis block. Once it reaches the current block, the Beacon API will become usable for your validators.</p> <h2 id="adding-validators">Adding Validators</h2> <p>The consensus client is the Beacon Node for validators to connect. Each consensus client has its own validator software, which is described in its documentation. Running a validator allows for sol staking, which is the most impactful and trustless means of supporting Ethereum. However, one has to deposit 32 ETH. To run a validator on your node with a lesser amount, you can use a decentralized pool with permissionless node operators such as Rocket Pool.</p> <h2 id="operating-a-node">Operating A Node</h2> <p>You should monitor your node often to ensure it runs correctly. Sometimes, it needs maintenance. While it does not need to be online all the time, it should be online as much as possible to ensure it is synced up to the network.</p> <h2 id="updating-clients">Updating Clients</h2> <p>Client software needs to be kept up-to-date to ensure it has all the security patches, features, and EIPs. This is especially important before a hard fork. Before a major network update, a blog is published to inform the community. You can subscribe to these announcements to receive an email when a node needs to be updated.</p> <h2 id="chaingatewayio-offers-a-simple-solution">Chaingateway.io Offers a Simple Solution</h2> <p>Setting up and maintaining a node is a lot of work, and very complex. However, you can get direct access to the blockchain without all the hassle via chaingateway.io.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>There are different types of Ethereum nodes, which include light nodes, full nodes, and archive nodes. Each has varying requirements. Running a node makes you an important participant in the global decentralized network and contributes to its security and decentralization.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chaingateway</name></author><category term="Blockchain"/><category term="Ethereum"/><category term="Node"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Blockchain"/><category term="Blockchain API"/><category term="Ethereum"/><category term="Smart Contracts"/><category term="Security"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Ethereum Node"/><category term="Nodes"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum nodes are computers that participate in the Ethereum blockchain network to verify, store, and create blocks.

In this example, only from localhost. 1 geth –mainnet 2 –datadir “/data/ethereum” 3 –http –authrpc.addr localhost 4 –authrpc.vhosts=”localhost” 5 –authrpc.port 8551 6 –authrpc.jwtsecret=/path/to/jwtsecret You can learn more about running Geth with a consensus client here. The execution client will start its core functions, pick endpoints, and begin searching for peers. Once it discovers peers, it will start syncing. The execution client will then wait for a connection from the consensus client. The current blockchain data will be available when the client has synced to the current state. Starting The Consensus Client A consensus client has to be started with the correct port configuration to establish a local RPC connection to the execution client. It has to be run with the exposed execution client port as a configuration argument. It also needs the path to the execution client’s jwt-secret to authenticate the RPC connection between them. Each consensus client has a configuration flag that takes the jwt token file path as an argument. It must be consistent with the jwtsecret path provided to the execution client. When running a validator node, ensure that you add a configuration flag that specifies the Ethereum address of the fee recipient. The address is where ether rewards are sent. Running A Consensus Client An example of a consensus client is Lodestar. To run it, install the Lodestar software by compiling it or download the Docker image. You can find an advanced setup guide here. 1 lodestar beacon 2 –rootDir=”/data/ethereum” 3 –network=mainnet 4 –eth1.enabled=true 5 –execution.urls=”http://127.0.0.1:8551” 6 –jwt-secret=”/path/to/jwtsecret” When the consensus client connects to the execution client to read the deposit contract and identify validators, it will also connect to other Beacon Node peers. It will then start syncing consensus slots from the genesis block. Once it reaches the current block, the Beacon API will become usable for your validators. Adding Validators The consensus client is the Beacon Node for validators to connect. Each consensus client has its own validator software, which is described in its documentation. Running a validator allows for sol staking, which is the most impactful and trustless means of supporting Ethereum. However, one has to deposit 32 ETH. To run a validator on your node with a lesser amount, you can use a decentralized pool with permissionless node operators such as Rocket Pool. Operating A Node You should monitor your node often to ensure it runs correctly. Sometimes, it needs maintenance. While it does not need to be online all the time, it should be online as much as possible to ensure it is synced up to the network. Updating Clients Client software needs to be kept up-to-date to ensure it has all the security patches, features, and EIPs. This is especially important before a hard fork. Before a major network update, a blog is published to inform the community. You can subscribe to these announcements to receive an email when a node needs to be updated. Chaingateway.io Offers a Simple Solution Setting up and maintaining a node is a lot of work, and very complex. However, you can get direct access to the blockchain without all the hassle via chaingateway.io. Summary There are different types of Ethereum nodes, which include light nodes, full nodes, and archive nodes. Each has varying requirements. Running a node makes you an important participant in the global decentralized network and contributes to its security and decentralization.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/11/blog_11_10.png"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/11/blog_11_10.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Set Up A Tron Node</title><link href="https://chaingateway.io/blog/How-to-Set-Up-a-Tron-Node/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Set Up A Tron Node"/><published>2023-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://chaingateway.io/blog/how-to-set-up-a-tron-node</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://chaingateway.io/blog/How-to-Set-Up-a-Tron-Node/"><![CDATA[<p>Tron is a blockchain platform working on creating a decentralized global digital content entertainment system. The Tron network relies on nodes spread throughout the world to validate transactions and maintain the security of the network. Here are the steps to set up a Tron Node.</p> <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2> <ul> <li>The Tron Node can be set up on Linux or MacOS.</li> <li>The recommended configuration is:</li> <li>Recommended Configuration</li> <li>CPU：16 cores</li> <li>RAM：32G</li> <li>SSD：2.5T+</li> <li>Bandwidth：100M</li> <li>the recommended configuration for creating a full node for block production is as follows:</li> <li>CPU：32 cores</li> <li>RAM：64G</li> </ul> <h2 id="deployment-steps">Deployment Steps</h2> <p>No matter the type of node, the deployment process is the same:</p> <h3 id="step-1---install-tools-and-dependencies">Step 1 - Install Tools and Dependencies</h3> <p>You will require Oracle JDK 1.8 and git</p> <h3 id="step-2--download-the-tron-full-node">Step 2 – Download the Tron Full Node</h3> <p>The next step is to download the full node. You can obtain the FullNode.jar by compiling the source code or by downloading <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">the released jar</a> directly.</p> <h3 id="step-3--start-the-node">Step 3 – Start the Node</h3> <p>In this step, you must first get the mainnet configure file: <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-deployment/blob/master/main_net_config.conf">main_net_config.conf</a>. You can find other network configuration files <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-deployment">here</a>. The full node contains the full historical data and acts as the entry point into the Tron Network. It provides HTTP APIL and Grpc API for external query. Using the fullnode, you can interact with the Tron Network. For instance, you can deploy contracts, interact with contracts, transfer assets, and more. The startup command for the mainnet fullnode is detailed below. The -c parameter specifies the configuration file of the fullnode.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar -c main_net_config.conf</code></p> <p>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC ：Specifies parallel garbage collection. To be placed before the -jar parameter, not at the end. -Xmx ：The maximum value of the JVM heap, which can be set to 80% of the physical memory. To start up a fullnode that can produce blocks for the mainnet, you should add the –witness parameter to the startup command; fullnode will run as a node that produces blocks. Besides supporting all functions of fullnode, the block-producing fullnode also supports block production and transaction packaging. Ensure you have a super representative account and receive votes from others. If the votes rank in the top 27, you will have to start a fullnode that can produce blocks to begin block production. You will also need to fill in the private key of the super representative address into the localwitness list in the main_net_config.conf. Alternatively, you can use the keystore + password method if you do not want to specify the private key in plain text. Here is how to do it. Once you do that, run this command to start the node:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar --witness -c main_net_config.conf</code></p> <p>Due to the size of the mainnet and nile testnet, it will take some time for the data to be synchronized. You can use <a href="https://developers.tron.network/docs/main-net-database-snapshots">Data Snapshots</a> to speed up the process. To do this, you will need to download the latest data snapshot and extract it to the output-directory directory of the Tron project. You can then start the node that it synchronizes using the data snapshot. To shut down the fullnode, you can use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill -15 process id</code>.</p> <h3 id="step-4--verify-the-full-node">Step 4- Verify the Full Node</h3> <p>Once a node is synced, you can verify its status using the Tron Grid API. Run this command in a new terminal window: tron-grid status It will return information about the node, including the block height and the version of the software. Once that is done, you are now a successful operator of a Tron Network full node.</p> <h2 id="try-chaingatewayio">Try Chaingateway.io</h2> <p>Setting up and maintaining a Tron Network node can be a lot of work. It is complex, and difficult to master. However, <a href="https://chaingateway.io">Chaingateway.io</a> has the perfect solution. The platform offers direct access to the Tron blockchain without all the complexity.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>Running a full node requires huge resources, including storage space and bandwidth. You also have to keep the node updated with the latest software releases to ensure it works properly and is secure. Running a node is crucial for developers who want to build on Tron or take part in the consensus mechanism. Using the steps above, you should be well on your way to setting up a full node and interaction with the Blockchain.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chaingateway</name></author><category term="Blockchain"/><category term="Tron"/><category term="API"/><category term="Tron Node"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Blockchain APIs"/><category term="Blockchain Nodes"/><category term="Tron Network"/><category term="Security"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Tron Node"/><category term="Tron Blockchain"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to set up a Tron Network node to help authenticate transactions on the Tron Blockchain Network.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/10/blog_10_16.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/10/blog_10_16.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Set Up A Binance Smart Chain Node</title><link href="https://chaingateway.io/blog/How-to-Set-Up-a-Binance-Smart-Chain-Node/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Set Up A Binance Smart Chain Node"/><published>2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://chaingateway.io/blog/how-to-set-up-a-binance-smart-chain-node</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://chaingateway.io/blog/How-to-Set-Up-a-Binance-Smart-Chain-Node/"><![CDATA[<p>BNB Smart or BSC is a blockchain working to provide an alternative and extension to the Ethereum blockchain.

These are snap and full, which be verified by flag –syncmode. The snap mode is used for the initial sync. It downloads the latest state instead of executing blocks from the Genesis block. When the initial sync is over, it switches to full sync. A full sync can also be used for the initial sync, which will execute all blocks from the genesis block. However, the amount of historical data is high, and it is thus not recommended. Instead, download a snapshot from the <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-snapshots">official repo</a> and begin the full sync using the snapshot. If you do not provide the flag syncmode, the default sync mode will depend on the state of the data folder.

Mastering blockchain APIs will be crucial to successfully implementing these use cases.</p> <h2 id="understanding-blockchain-api-technology">Understanding Blockchain API Technology</h2> <p>A blockchain API is a tool used to help developers interact with a blockchain network. It makes it easy to integrate the blockchain into an application or website. In short, it simplifies a developer’s interaction with a blockchain network while assisting them in building a decentralized application. One way it does this is by providing access to data on blocks, smart contracts, transactions, account balances, and more. It lets users send messages on the blockchain without writing their own code. For developers, they will often interact with APIs using the JSON-RPC architecture. They call on the API via WbSockets or HTTPS to send or receive data from the blockchain. Additionally, they can use standard SDKs to exchange data with a blockchain. There are also enhanced APIs that can save time on the development effort. They include NFT APIs, DeFi APIs, and wallet APIs built on top of a standard API.</p> <h2 id="use-cases-for-a-blockchain-api">Use Cases for a Blockchain API</h2> <p>There are numerous use cases for blockchain APIs. They can be used to create DApps, secure data, and power financial technology solutions. Additionally, they can be used to facilitate digital identity authentication. Blockchain APIs can also build interfaces between blockchain networks and other systems without creating custom code. Additionally, they can access data such as accounts, smart contracts, transaction data, and more. A specific use case for blockchain APIs is in crypto wallets. A crypto wallet is used to help manage the crypto in your crypto address. The wallet is a central location to manage crypto and connect to DApps. A crypto wallet API can link to different blockchain networks and perform various functions like sales, order placements, and open order cancellations. One example of this is the Binance API. Another use case is digital banks. A blockchain API allows a bank to integrate its products with crypto banking services like lending, making payments, and accepting deposits. The API can also allow a bank to notify customers about fees and balances. Blockchain APIs can be used for portfolio tracking. They can feed historical and live blockchain data to portfolio management software, allowing users to manage their crypto assets more efficiently. Such an API can offer a portfolio owner data like transactions made from a given address, track fees, monitor deposits and withdrawals, and more. APIs are also connected to exchanges to provide various services. For instance, they can sort coins by market cap, daily trading volume, and other metrics. Additionally, they can be used for order placement. Blockchain APIs are also used for crypto custody services. They allow custody providers to provide users with a digital management solution integrated with a crypto wallet to store crypto securely. These custody services are especially important in storing private keys. Blockchain APIs can also be connected with crypto mining software to boost efficiency. They track information on the blockchain and notify users when it is most efficient to mine a given network. The result is that miners can maximize their profitability. Blockchain APIs are also useful for crypto lending services. They are used to give information that can be used to establish a borrower’s credit score. Blockchain APIs are often used to lend and borrow crypto directly between users and to collect interest. A blockchain API is also useful for crypto accounting and taxes. It ensures that users can accurately calculate how much tax they owe to the last decimal. They work by linking a crypto wallet to a crypto tax app, allowing users to receive real-time updates on their gains and losses. Consequently, they can be used to determine the most advantageous accounting methods for tax purposes. Blockchain APIs are also useful for facilitating the operation of crypto payment service providers. They can convert crypto via exchange, generate deposit addresses, and more. A blockchain API is also useful when building a blockchain explorer. An explorer is used to explore data on the blockchain, which is gathered via an API. The API will be useful in ensuring that the explorer presents use and real-time data on the state of the blockchain. Blockchain APIs are also useful in connecting data from the real world to oracles, which are then sent to smart contracts. Consequently, they allow smart contracts to communicate with the outside world.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>As the internet evolves into Web3, crypto, and NFTs will continue to grow. Blockchain APIs will have an important role in facilitating this evolution. They will improve connectivity and create a unified environment for developing various use cases. It will lead to more opportunities for collaboration and ownership. However, the technology still needs fine-tuning, which is already happening. A strong community of developers is emerging to solve the existing challenges. As blockchain APIs speed up blockchain adoption, it will bolster the global economy, making it more efficient and less risky.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chaingateway</name></author><category term="Blockchain"/><category term="API"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Blockchain APIs"/><category term="DApps"/><category term="Smart Contracts"/><category term="Security"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Web3 Future"/><category term="Decentralized Web3"/><category term="Use Cases"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A list of the various use cases for a blockchain API to foster efficiency, improve speed of blockchain-based transactions while promoting mass adoption of blockhain technology.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/09/blog_09_14.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/09/blog_09_14.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">The Use Of Webhooks To Process Deposits Automatically</title><link href="https://chaingateway.io/blog/The-Use-of-Webhooks-to-Process-Deposits-Automatically/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Use Of Webhooks To Process Deposits Automatically"/><published>2023-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://chaingateway.io/blog/The-Use-of-Webhooks-to-Process-Deposits-Automatically</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://chaingateway.io/blog/The-Use-of-Webhooks-to-Process-Deposits-Automatically/"><![CDATA[<p>As an app developer, you may have encountered webhook integrations in some of your applications and wondered what they were. Webhooks are growing in popularity, and you should understand them. According to Google trends, interest in webhooks has risen astronomically in recent years.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-webhook">What is a Webhook?</h2> <p>Webhooks are one of the ways web applications exchange data. They allow real-time data transmission across apps based on a predefined event. For instance, on a restaurant-based app, a webhook would notify you when someone checks in. You can then run any automated processes once the event is triggered. Data will be sent over the web from the app where the event originated to a handling application that receives the signal. The data exchange happens over a webhook URL created by the receiving app and acts like a phone number that other apps can dial when an event occurs. Data sent to the webhook URL is known as the payload.</p> <h2 id="the-significance-of-webhooks-in-automating-payments">The Significance of Webhooks in Automating Payments</h2> <p>For a membership-based site, a webhook would prove useful. Whenever the customer uses the payment gateway to pay for a service, you would have to input their details in the membership app so that they can log in. One way to get over this is to have the payment gateway and your app communication. Consequently, they are automatically added to the membership app when they pay. A webhook is one way to ensure that communication takes place. Webhooks can save a lot of time, and they are so popular that you can integrate them into most of the web apps you already use. For instance, they can be connected to email marketing software with other apps to create new opportunities. The webhook could be connected to the payment gateway and the email marketing software so that you receive an alert when a payment bounces. Webhooks can be used to sync customer data in other apps. For instance, when a user changes their email address, the change can be reflected in the CRM. Webhooks are also useful for sending information about events to external databases like Google Big Query for more analysis. Webhooks can also be used to automate payments. By connecting to the payment gateway, they can send a signal for when an event occurs, which can be used to send the required funds automatically. In the future Web3 internet, webhooks will have a unique role to play in facilitating micropayments and instant settlement. Their ability to instantly send information will be useful for automating payments in Web3.</p> <h2 id="are-webhooks-apis">Are Webhooks APIs?</h2> <p>Webhooks and APIs are often mentioned together. However, while they are similar, they are not the same. Webhooks are one of the options that apps can use to exchange data, while API is another option. One of the major differences is in how they receive data. An API provides data via polling when the app occasionally sends requests for data to an API server to see if it has been updated with new information. A webhook allows the provider to push data to the application as soon as an event is triggered. Consequently, webhooks are sometimes called reverse APIs. With an API, the application has to pull data from the server to remain updated periodically. At the same time, the webhook receives data pushed from the server when an event is triggered. In the real world, an API is analogous to making periodic calls to a store to ask if they have brought new merchandise. On the other hand, a webhook is a system that lets the retailer call you when they have new merchandise. The result is that it saves time for both parties. Webhooks consume fewer resources since they do not require constant polling for new data. However, APIs are still popular since not all applications have webhooks integration. Additionally, they do not work for every use case. Sometimes, an app only wants to get information about the end-result instead of every event. A webhook would only notify the app about an event, while if you need to make changes based on new data, you will still need an API. Another reason APIs are still useful is that the webhook payload may not have all the data you need about the event. To overcome this issue, many applications today support webhooks and APIs. When webhook integration is lacking, some middleware applications have come in to fill the gap. These apps will poll the API and send the updates using webhooks. Middleware apps with this capability can connect apps that lack webhook integration, allowing them to share data.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>Webhooks are an important part of the internet, and their popularity is growing. They allow applications to send data instantly, which is useful for automated payments. While they work similarly to APIs, they have different roles, each with unique use cases. One of the best ways to understand the full capabilities of webhooks is to try them yourself. With a few connections between your apps, you will get a feel for how they work. Within a short time, you will be a pro at using webhooks for everything, including automated payments.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chaingateway</name></author><category term="Blockchain"/><category term="API"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Blockchain APIs"/><category term="DApps"/><category term="Smart Contracts"/><category term="Security"/><category term="Web3"/><category term="Web3 Future"/><category term="Decentralized Web3"/><category term="Webhooks"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How webhooks can be used to process deposits on the blockchain automatically to improve efficiency, and speed.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/08/bitblade_illustration_of_blockchain_colors_like_image_style_lik_2.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://chaingateway.io/assets/images/blog/2023/08/bitblade_illustration_of_blockchain_colors_like_image_style_lik_2.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry></feed>
